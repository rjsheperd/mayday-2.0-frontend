                Founded by Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig and Republican strategist Mark McKinnon, Mayday (MAYDAY.US) is an independent political action committee (PAC) dedicated to electing a Congress that would pass fundamental reform of the way campaigns are funded. Achieving our goals would mean that we would be the last super PAC &ndash; “the super PAC to end all super PACs.”

                Mayday launched in 2014 with the successful completion of two kick-started, crowdfunding rounds. The first began on May 1 and met its $1M goal in just 13 days. The second met its $5M goal on Independence Day. In total, Mayday raised $11 million from over 68,000 Americans across all 50 states.

                We then piloted an intervention in the 2014 midterm elections with eight races. Our aims were  (1) To send a signal to members of Congress that opposing reform could have real electoral consequences and supporting reform could have electoral benefits, (2) To demonstrate that the issue of money in politics moves voters, and C) To learn lessons about campaigning on our issue this cycle to set ourselves. We lost most of those races, but we learned invaluable lessons about what works when campaigning on our issue. <a href="https://v1.mayday.us/campaigns/20141107-reporting-back/">You can read our full post-election report here.</a>

                A super PAC is an independent expenditure-only committee. Unlike traditional PACs, super PACs are allowed to raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, corporations, or unions. They may advocate for the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate. However, they may not donate funds to a candidate, campaign, or political party. They are also prohibited from coordinating directly with a candidate or candidate’s committee.

                Like all other super PACs, Mayday’s plan is to raise and spend money to influence political outcomes. Unlike all other super PACs, Mayday is kick-started, crowd-funded, and committed to doing whatever it takes to fix our broken democracy.

                In order to reform America’s broken system of government, we are using that system against itself. In an age where money speaks loudest in Congress, Mayday PAC is our megaphone. As a super PAC, we are able to insert ourselves into elections, supporting reform candidates and creating an incentive to be on the right side of this issue.

                Yes. We are prohibited from coordination with any candidate or candidate’s committee. This means that we’re not allowed to recruit our own candidates or strategize with the candidates we support.

                As an independent expenditure-only committee, we are required to report all donors who contribute more than $200. These reports must be filed with the FEC.

                Yes. We want to use big money (collected from the many) to fight big money (collected from the few). Ironic, we understand. But embrace the irony. Everyone recognizes that politics costs money in America. And we don’t imagine a future where campaigns are free. But if we can pull together a large enough pool of money through this campaign, we can convince Americans that they can change the way money matters in politics. We can create a system in which it isn’t the influence of a few that matters. Instead, as any democracy should, it would be the influence of a majority that matters.

                &ndash; Eighty-five percent of the funding for Congressional campaigns comes from a tiny fraction of the population: no more than .05% of Americans gives even the maximum amount to one candidate for Congress. The number giving $10,000 or more is less than .01%.
              </p>
              <p class="hang-line">
                &ndash; This concentration gives the funders of political campaigns enormous power, either directly (as direct contributors) or indirectly (through lobbying and super PACs). As Members of Congress become dependent upon these funders &ndash; spending anywhere between 30% and 70% of their time raising money &ndash; the influence of these funders grows. A trivial number of large contributors can and do block progress on any number of issues that directly impact the vast majority Americans. As a recent study from Princeton concludes, “economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. governmental policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.”

              <p class="hang-line">
                &ndash; This dynamic is not partisan. It blocks reforms on the Left and Right. It blocks substantial legislative initiatives &ndash; such as climate change legislation, or meaningful healthcare reform. It also blocks efforts to simplify taxes or shrink the size of government: All things being equal, complicated taxes and a more extensive government increase the ability of Members of Congress to raise money. As Robert Kaiser details in his book, So Damn Much Money (2010), that fact interferes with the legislative agenda of the Right as much as of the Left.

                &ndash; The founders and supporters of Mayday PAC believe that this dynamic has destroyed the capacity of the United States government to govern. We believe it is critical to find a way to change the way elections are funded &ndash; to free legislators to do the jobs they were elected to do, and to give Americans the voice that it is our right to have in our  democracy.

                Reform is only possible if we believe in it and are willing to do something about it. 96% of Americans think big money in politics is a problem, but 90% don’t think we can do anything about it. Let’s close that gap.
